<h3 id="saferstatus"> SaferStatus - a GPS enabled warning sign for Semi-truck Trailers</h3>

<p>AVR/C/digital and analog circuit design/sensor data integration - 
Western Flyer Express wanted a sign on the back of their trailers that would
warn drivers of the truck slowing or stopping to prevent rear-end collisions.
I delivered 2 iterations of a prototype for patenting and demonstration, and the 
customer loved it. We were making good stride on designing the MVP for Chinese 
manufacturing when Clevyr decided to refocus on their core business.</p>
    
<h3 id="mcp-webapptoparsegeomaneuversandnotifyoperators">MCP - Webapp to parse GEO maneuvers and notify operators</h3>

<p>Python/redis/JavaScript/docker/Linux - I built and maintain a
production tool that interacts with the National Airspace system
allowing our operators to be notified and download a GEO satellite
maneuver takes place so they can update WAAS.</p>

<h3 id="thewaasbrewery-2milliondatapointsperminute">The WAAS Brewery - 2 million data points per minute</h3>

<p>Python, ZeroMQ, docker, Graphite RRD &#8211; I built a real-time monitoring
system that captures and decodes network packets on our continental
UDP ring. It captures the raw packets and queues them to be consumed
by workers. The final product - realtime plots in graphite or any
beautiful custom plotting tool that can listen on a port and parse
json.</p>

<h3 id="ionosphericmonitoring-d3.jsplotting">Ionospheric Monitoring - d3.js plotting</h3>

<p><a href="http://waas.faa.gov/static/sog/iono/">waas.faa.gov/static/sog/iono/</a></p>

<p>Python Flask/JavaScript &#8211; Live plots of ionospheric activity. It is
part of a dashboard at the FAA. It is built on the Brewery described
above, and used as an example to teach other engineers how to build
web tools on the Brewery.</p>

<h3 id="deadrugbusts-personalproject">DEA Drug Busts - personal project</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jhaubrich/dea_busts">github.com/jhaubrich/dea_busts)</a></p>

<p>I coded this up when I was buying a house. It displays on a map where
the meth labs were. It&#8217;s very simple, but people talk about it more
than anything else I&#8217;ve done.</p>
