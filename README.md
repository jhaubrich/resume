I am a senior software engineer based in Oklahoma City. I have been
writing software professionally since 2011. I get passionate about
Human-computer interaction, and creating reliable infrastructure that
is easy to use and maintain. The worst programmer I have ever worked
with was me from 6 months ago. That guy.

Outside of engineering I am a musician, a brewer, and a gamer.

## Experience

### Open Source Developer
I've made some small contributions to [a bunch of small
projects](http://github.com/jhaubrich).

### FAA - Wide Area Augmentation System
**Software Engineer** Sept 2011 to Present. I was brought on as an
engineer and trained on GPS, but my work has been almost exclusively
software and the devops to support it.
* I implemented and evangelized build automation/version control (Jenkins/Github)
* I built a real-time monitoring system that promisuously listens for packets on UDP and sends them through a worker queue implemented in python and ZeroMQ
* I maintain some redundant linux servers for the various production systems I built.

### Falcon Rigs
**Mechanical Engineer** Feb 2011 to Sept 2011. Falcon Rigs is an oil rig
manufacturer.
* I helped modernized the design and build process by converting
the constructed trucks into 3D models that can produce detailed
schematics
* I laser cut the company logo onto an 8 ft fan guard. It looked
great, and was fit to every subsequent truck.

### University of Central Oklahoma
**Research Assistant** Aug 2008 to May 2010.
* I built an automated system to measure flow in microchannels
(microcontroller circuit design/python/Linux)
* I built the department's computing cluster and configured it to run
microfluid simulations. My work was published
