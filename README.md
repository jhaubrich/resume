I am a senior software developer based in Oklahoma City. I have been
writing software for the web professionally since 2011. I have two
passions in software. The first is building beautiful tools for people
to share knowledge, advice and experience. The second is creating
reliable infrastructure that is easy to use and maintain.

Outside of engineering I am a musician, brewer, and avid gamer.

## Experience

### Open Source Developer
I've made some small contributions to [a bunch of small
projects](http://github.com/jhaubrich).

### FAA - Wide Area Augmentation System
**Software Engineer** Sept 2011 to Present. I was brought on as an
engineer and trained on GPS, but my work has been almost exclusively
software and the devops to support it. I maintain a handfull of linux
servers for the various production systems I built. I evangelized and
implemented Jenkins and github for our team of 20 devs. WAAS is a GPS
augmentation system that adds integrity to user positions.

### Falcon Rigs
**Mechanical Engineer** Feb 2011 to Sept 2011. Falcon Rigs is an oil rig
manufacturer. I modernized the design and build process by converting
the constructed trucks into 3D models that can produce detailed
schematics. My proudest moment is laser cutting the company's logo
onto an 8 ft fan guard. It looked great, and was fit to every
subsequent truck.

### University of Central Oklahoma
**Research Assistant** Aug 2008 to May 2010. I built an automated
system to measure flow in microchannels (microcontroller circuit
design/python/Linux). I also built the department's computing cluster
and configured it to run microfluid simulations. My work was
published.

## Education
